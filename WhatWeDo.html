                    <h3>Cresencia Village aspires to establish a nutritionally improved barangay with healthy and well-nourished people. To obtain the goal of nourishment, the barangay aims to promote health related programs providing citizens' different kinds of needs. These programs aims to keep track of one's nutritional status and perform essential ways in order for them to achieve a great and healthy lifestyle. <br>

There are numerous programs held regularly in the barangay.</h3><br>
						<h3>Feeding Program</h3>
				    <p>
                        When a child’s weight is below three standard deviations from the median weight-for-age, the child is said to be severely underweight, while if the weight is lower than two standard deviations from the growth standard but higher than three standard deviations, then the child is moderately underweight. <br>

                    
                        In the Philippines, about 6 to 8% of children under five were wasted, and about 2% were severely wasted. About a third of children under five in the Philippines have stunted growth, and a fifth is underweight. Just like across the world, in the Philippines, the share of children under five who had stunted growth and those underweight, have been decreasing. (J. Albert, 2015)<br>

                    
                        Conducting a feeding program yearly aims to reduce hunger, aid in development of children, improve nutritional status and effectively promote good health. 
                    </p>
						<h3>Operation Timbang</h3>
                    <p>
						The Barangay Nutrition Scholar (BNS) Program is a human resource development strategy of the Philippine Plan of Action for Nutrition, which involves the recruitment, training, deployment and supervision of volunteer workers or barangay nutrition scholars (BNS). Children of age 1 are weighed every month and children of ages 2 to 6 are weighed every quater.<br>

	                   The barangay highly encourages parents or guardians to assess the weight of their children regularly by joining the Operation Timbang program. Nutritional information is gathered which is then used to identify and quantify underweight and overweight children in the baragay. Generated records makes it easier to monitor children's health concerns and the approriate nutrition services to be provided for those whose weights fall below normal. Results also serves as an assessment of the effectiveness of nutritional programs.
