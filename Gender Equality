Cresencia Village 

Mother's class

Mother's class doesn't only advocate human rights but also support gender equality. The usual situation that transpires among families is that mothers stay at home along with their children and fathers go for work.  The barangay officials of Cresencia Village organizes a motherâ€™s class for empowering women that can benefit health and wellness of their families and the society at large. This touches the rights to employment of women and empowerment which aims for providing women a possible career path.
