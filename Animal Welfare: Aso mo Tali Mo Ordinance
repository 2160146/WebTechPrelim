Aso Mo Tali Mo Ordinance

	Being a dog owner involves a lot of responsibilities, one of which is maintaining control over and not allowing it to roam around streets without a leash. This ordinance helps prevent dog owners from violating the rule and and aims to maintain discipline among all owners not knowing there is a published violation fee. Not only that, it also lessens the possibility of having dog bite victims and most importantly to keep dogs safe.
