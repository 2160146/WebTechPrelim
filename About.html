				<h1>About us</h1>
				<p>Every human has the rights to live freely regardless of age, gender, race and others.
				Everyone has their own basic rights entitled to themselves like equality, civil and political rights, 
				freedom of speech and expression, social and cultural rights, rights to education, and many more of the likes. 
				It is prohibited that brutal acts be practiced anywhere such as slavery, torture, arbitrary arrests and such.
				</p>
				<p>Our group believes that each one of us should have their own freedom of choices to make without constraints
			   that blind our rightful paths. We are committed to help people find their true happiness and not be bound to
			   so many rules that it locks them out of their senses. We are humans and we should be treated like one. </p>
